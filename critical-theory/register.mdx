## Register

A situationally defined variety of language that systematically varies according to social role, relative power, familiarity between interlocutors, formality, and communicative context, rather than characteristics of the speaker.

### Key characteristics

Register differences are reflected in features such as:

- Intonation patterns
- Speech acts
- Discourse particles
- Discourse markers

### Register shifting

Individuals command multiple registers and shift among them as social roles change.
